# OpenCV
Image Processing library tool

OpenCV was designed for computational effi ciency and with a strong focus on realtime
applications. OpenCV is written in optimized C and can take advantage of multicore
processors. If you desire further automatic optimization on Intel architectures
[Intel], you can buy Intelâ€™s Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) libraries [IPP], which
consist of low-level optimized routines in many diff erent algorithmic areas. OpenCV
automatically uses the appropriate IPP library at runtime if that library is installed.
